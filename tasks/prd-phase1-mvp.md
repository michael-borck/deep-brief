# Product Requirements Document: Video Analysis App - Phase 1 (MVP)

## Introduction/Overview

The Video Analysis App MVP (Phase 1) is a desktop application that helps students, educators, and professionals analyze presentation videos by combining speech transcription, visual analysis, and AI-powered feedback. This first phase focuses on core video processing capabilities to provide actionable insights on speaking performance and basic visual effectiveness.

The problem this solves: Users currently lack an easy way to objectively analyze their presentation skills, relying on subjective feedback or expensive coaching. This MVP provides automated, data-driven insights to help users improve their presentation delivery.

## Goals

1. **Core Processing**: Successfully process video files (MP4, MOV, AVI, WebM) up to 500MB with reliable audio extraction and scene detection
2. **Speech Analysis**: Provide accurate speech-to-text transcription with word-level timestamps and basic speaking metrics
3. **Visual Insights**: Extract and analyze key frames from video scenes with basic descriptions
4. **Actionable Feedback**: Generate structured reports with specific, actionable recommendations for improvement
5. **User Experience**: Deliver a professional, easy-to-use interface that requires minimal technical knowledge
6. **Performance**: Process videos efficiently with clear progress indicators and reasonable processing times

## User Stories

- **US-1**: As a student, I want to upload my practice presentation video so that I can receive feedback before my actual presentation
- **US-2**: As a student, I want to see my speaking rate and filler word usage so that I can improve my delivery
- **US-3**: As a student, I want to read a clear transcript of my presentation so that I can review my content organization

### Secondary Users: Educators
- **US-4**: As an educator, I want to analyze student presentation videos so that I can provide consistent, objective feedback
- **US-5**: As an educator, I want to see scene-by-scene breakdowns so that I can identify specific areas for improvement

### Tertiary Users: Professionals
- **US-6**: As a professional, I want to analyze my sales pitch recordings so that I can refine my presentation before client meetings
- **US-7**: As a professional, I want to track my presentation improvements over time so that I can measure my progress

## Design Considerations

### User Interface
- **Professional Appearance**: Use Gradio's Soft theme with blue/gray color scheme and Inter font

## Open Questions

1. **Model Size vs. Accuracy**: Should we use Whisper "base" model for speed or "small" model for better accuracy?
2. **Scene Detection Tuning**: What's the optimal default threshold for scene detection across different video types?
3. **Report Customization**: How much customization should users have over report content and format?
4. **Processing Feedback**: What level of detail should we provide in processing progress updates?
5. **Error Handling**: How should we handle partially corrupted videos or videos with very poor audio quality?
6. **Output Storage**: Should we maintain any local history of analyses or make each session independent?
7. **Installation Complexity**: What's the acceptable level of technical setup required for end users?

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

- **Configuration-Driven**: Use YAML configuration files for easy adjustment of processing parameters
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Testing Strategy**: Unit tests for core processing, integration tests for full pipeline

### Deployment Strategy
- **Local Installation**: pip-installable package with automated dependency installation
