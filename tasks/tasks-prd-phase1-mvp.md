### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `pytest` to run tests: `pytest src/ -v` to run all tests with verbose output
- Configuration should be loaded from YAML files with environment variable overrides
- All processing should support progress callbacks for UI updates
